			Inheritance
👀 Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties of another.
👀 With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
👀The class which inherits the properties of the other is know as subclass, derived class or child class.
👀 The class whose properties are inherited from is know as superclass, base class or parent class.

Syntax

class Super {

class Sub extends Super {
   .....
   .....
}

*************************NOTE*****************************************************************************
👀A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. 
👀Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, 
👀but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

Public Access Modifier - Private
👀A class, method, constructor, interface, etc. 
👀declared public can be accessed from any other class. 
👀Therefore, fields, methods, blocks declared inside a public class 
👀can be accessed from any class belonging to the Java Universe.******************************************

Protected Access Modifier - Protected
👀Variables, methods, and constructors, 
👀which are declared protected in a superclass 
👀can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package 
👀or any class within the package of the protected members' class.*****************************************

Private Access Modifier - Private
👀Methods, variables, and constructors 
👀that are declared private can only be accessed within the declared class itself.
👀Private access modifier is the most restrictive access level.
👀NB####Class and interfaces cannot be private.#####*********************************************************
