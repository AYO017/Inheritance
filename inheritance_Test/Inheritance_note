			Inheritance
ðŸ‘€ Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties of another.
ðŸ‘€ With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
ðŸ‘€The class which inherits the properties of the other is know as subclass, derived class or child class.
ðŸ‘€ The class whose properties are inherited from is know as superclass, base class or parent class.

*************************NOTE*****************************************************************************
ðŸ‘€A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. 
ðŸ‘€Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, 
ðŸ‘€but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
